    About the job
Who are we? ATG is leading the transformation of the multi-billion-dollar global auction industry. The company has grown rapidly over the last 7 years, expanding from ~$18m of revenue and $3m of profits seven years ago to over $170m of revenue and over $80m of profits today. The company IPO’d in 2021 and has had a successful run both during the covid period and after. ATG is early in our journey to establish a hugely influential global internet company that is revolutionizing one of the last industries in the world yet to move significantly online. 



What do we do? ATG connects thousands of auction houses, listing millions of items worth over $15 billion annually (and growing!), to buyers in over 170 countries around the world. These buyers generate over 100 million bids a year for our sellers, helping them achieve maximum value for the goods they sell. We help auctioneers sell everything from medieval swords to combine harvesters, paintings, and decorative art through to classic cars, furniture, and Caterpillar forklifts. We do this through 8 marketplaces that leverage our online auction technologies. We make auctioneers more efficient; we make small companies big by bringing them access to millions of bidders they could never find on their own, and we bring them technology they could never afford alone. We bring bidders choice of unique and specialized items, convenience, and trust. We do it all in a shared success model that accelerates growth of the circular economy and sustainable buying. With ATG, our buyers and sellers win but so too does the planet! We have ethical ambition and it’s something our employees value and is a key part of who we are….as well as being a high growth marketplace company with excellent competitive positioning! 



Where are we now? ATG achieved “first mover advantage” in each of the sectors we serve. As such, we have benefited from incredible network effects meaning that as we brought the most sellers, we attracted more buyers and as we brought more buyers, we then organically attracted more sellers. This symbiotic relationship has been pivotal to our profitable growth. 



ATG established a vision that has 3 big strategic phases for how we will lead the transformation of the auction industry. Phase 1 was assembling the critical mass of marketplaces and technologies that would serve as the foundation on which we would build. It enabled us to capitalize on the network effects and set ourselves apart from competitors. We are now in Phase 2. Here, we are building out eCommerce basics, following the well-trodden path of online marketplace development---improved UI and UX, implementing best practice conversion funnel actions, improving trust, adding payment and shipping options, and much more. The goal is: Maximize Quality Bidders. On the seller side, we are focused on creating a one-stop-shop for auctioneers where they can get access to auction marketplaces where they find the best bidders, interconnectivity to enable them to rapidly reach the bidders on ANY of our marketplaces, digital marketing services, shipping services to improve their efficiency and customer experiences and payments to complete the fulfilment. Phase 3 entails transformative ways to use these services to bring even more value to auctioneers and bidders alike. We can go into that if you progress through the interview process! 



Who are we looking for? As a Senior .NET Engineer at ATG you will be a part of a collaborative agile team that is focused on delivering high value features to our customers through a high-transaction e-commerce web application. You embrace a DevOps philosophy, push to deliver frequently, and understand that quality is everyone’s responsibility. Influence the technical aspects of the software engineering team by making architectural and design decisions, guiding team members in technical matters and system modifications. Your team will be expected to take ownership of the products you work on and actively embrace improving how you achieve outcomes. You will have great opportunities to grow as ATG continues to expand, integrate, and build new products.
 
What your contributions will be:  
Design, develop, and maintain robust, scalable, and high-performance applications using .NET Core. 
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to understand project requirements and deliver high-quality solutions. 
Conduct code reviews, identify areas for optimization, and ensure code quality and security standards are met. 
Maintain and monitor business critical platforms and services. 
Troubleshoot and resolve technical issues, ensuring minimal downtime and optimal performance. 
 
What will you bring to the team? 
The ability to pair with other engineers to solve problems together. 
Collaboration and an innovative mindset 
Willingness, to share your opinions and approaches, and hear others’, so we can find the best solutions as a team. 
Ability to multitask, prioritize and manage time effectively. 
 
What you need for success: 
Bachelor’s degree in computer science or related field or equivalent technical experience. 
5+ years of Software development experience. 
Expert .NET core experience (3+ years). 
Experience with front-end technologies such as React, Next.js etc.

    About the job
Democratize Access To Credit 

Together we’ll dismantle barriers to housing for working families to use data to eliminate the racial wealth gap. The ability to build credit from rental payments has the potential to give over 45 million renters with little to no credit a pathway into the financial system. Those individuals then stand to save over $200,000 in reduced lifetime interest payments, build home equity by qualifying for mortgages, and build wealth by passing job screening requirements.


The Engineering Team 

We are building a team of owners and changemakers. It is not enough to have the intention to do good –Esusu engineers translate intent into action and outcomes. We believe that accomplishing our ambitious goals cannot be done by lone heroes. Lasting change requires work by determined and collaborative individuals with a customer-first mindset. Our engineers aim to delight our customers and drive our business and team forward by leveraging their technical skills, empathetic curiosity, and teamwork.


Our back-end is microservice based, hosted in AWS and mainly written in Go. Our front-end is based on React and written in Typescript. Our mobile apps are built using Flutter. Our data infrastructure is based on MongoDB, PostgreSQL, S3, Sagemaker, Snowflake, Talend, and mainly written in Python.


We are continuously innovating, and always open to new solutions. Because Esusu is a financial services company, we are obsessive about every aspect of compliance and security. We embrace a DevOps environment where the team is responsible for the full spectrum of development, testing, deployment, and maintenance, including working with product and business operations teams to create customer-focused solutions. Even though we are 100% remote, Esusu’s culture is intensely collaborative.


The Opportunity

We are seeking a Senior Engineer with back-end, distributed, api-based, and platform systems experience who has worked in the credit reporting, financial, and/or accounting space.

This role requires a high degree of collaboration with senior leadership, key managers, and product owners across the organization (e.g, Product, Credit Reporting Specialists, Operations, Risk Management). Your product and technical guidance along with working through and empowering others will enable new products and improve current ones in order to reach more customers and provide delightful and enriching customer experiences.


You will be working on our next generation back-end services and credit reporting engine that will enable Esusu to benefit millions of people. This work will allow you to own and lead the development of key features across multiple lines of business. In addition to the technical responsibilities, you will coach, mentor, and develop our engineers by providing professional training and direct mentorship. You will help recruit, hire, and onboard new talent into the team. You will ensure efficient delivery through effective planning, setting expectations, prioritizing, and delegating. You will exhibit and foster Esusu’s culture and operating principles.

You get involved in troubleshooting, building proof of concepts, and architecting systems and features. Your experience as a technologist enables you to optimally function in engineering and data design discussions. You champion automation and look for opportunities to automate and codify manual processes.
Compliance and Security: Security considerations are always top of mind for you. You demonstrate good stewardship of data which is demonstrated in your planning and design approach. You apply compliance and governance considerations to every decision you and your team make; making sure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. You help the company achieve compliance and security attestations.
Empathetic Leader: Your leadership style sets the tone for communication and collaboration within your teams. You invest time in regular 1:1s with your directs and peers. You provide direction and autonomy to your teams and empower them to deliver within time and budget. You coach and provide regular feedback/advice to growth and develop the individuals in your teams. You leverage radical candor, directness, and kindness when communicating with others.
Balance Velocity with Long Term Goals: You balance thinking big with delivering the right thing in an agile and speedy manner. Your and your team’s work is of the highest quality and you continue to raise the bar within your immediate team and our organization.

At Gemini, our mission is to unlock the next era of financial, creative, and personal freedom.

In the United States, we have a flexible hybrid work policy for employees who live within 30 miles of our office headquartered in New York City and our office in Seattle. Employees within the New York and Seattle metropolitan areas are expected to work from the designated office twice a week, unless there is a job-specific requirement to be in the office every workday. Employees outside of these areas are considered part of our remote-first workforce. We believe our hybrid approach for those near our NYC and Seattle offices increases productivity through more in-person collaboration where possible.

The Department: Onchain

In our work, we research and build applicable software and hardware security approaches to support our signing environment. An ideal candidate would have experience in the implementation of software that was used with one or more security areas (e.g., signing, encrypting, load-time attestation, digital signatures, sealing, binding).

    About the job
About The Company

Gemini is a global crypto and Web3 platform founded by Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss in 2014. Gemini offers a wide range of crypto products and services for individuals and institutions in over 70 countries.

Crypto is about giving you greater choice, independence, and opportunity. We are here to help you on your journey. We build crypto products that are simple, elegant, and secure. Whether you are an individual or an institution, we help you buy, sell, and store your bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

At Gemini, our mission is to unlock the next era of financial, creative, and personal freedom.

In the United States, we have a flexible hybrid work policy for employees who live within 30 miles of our office headquartered in New York City and our office in Seattle. Employees within the New York and Seattle metropolitan areas are expected to work from the designated office twice a week, unless there is a job-specific requirement to be in the office every workday. Employees outside of these areas are considered part of our remote-first workforce. We believe our hybrid approach for those near our NYC and Seattle offices increases productivity through more in-person collaboration where possible.

The Department: Crypto Core

At Gemini, our mission is to unlock the next era of financial, creative, and personal freedom.

In the United States, we have a flexible hybrid work policy for employees who live within 30 miles of our office headquartered in New York City and our office in Seattle. Employees within the New York and Seattle metropolitan areas are expected to work from the designated office twice a week, unless there is a job-specific requirement to be in the office every workday. Employees outside of these areas are considered part of our remote-first workforce. We believe our hybrid approach for those near our NYC and Seattle offices increases productivity through more in-person collaboration where possible.

The Department: Crypto Core

In our work, we research and build applicable software and hardware security approaches to support our signing environment. An ideal candidate would have experience in the implementation of software that was used with one or more security areas (e.g., signing, encrypting, load-time attestation, digital signatures, sealing, binding). This engineer will also work closely with various teams including our Security Operations, Custody, Product Security, Wallet Engineering, and Platform Engineering teams.

OUR MISSION

Calibrate is on a mission to change the way the world treats weight. We’re defining a new category in metabolic health that mirrors what the research shows—that weight reflects our biology, not our willpower.

We’ve built a suite of products that combine medication with our proprietary intensive lifestyle intervention to deliver results that last.Calibrate launched in 2020 direct-to-consumer and has since expanded into enterprise channels to increase access to effective obesity treatment.

Calibrate’s programs bring decades of clinical research directly to consumers, immersing members in a biweekly 1:1 coaching program and curriculum that educates and encourages them to build enduring healthy habits across the four areas essential to lasting metabolic health: food, sleep, exercise, and emotional health. A purpose-built app enables daily tracking of food, energy levels, weight, and bi-weekly goals and helps members interact with their Coaching and Medical teams, while a members’ group and events calendar create additional opportunities to engage with the Calibrate community.
