**Explanation:**

* **job_position:**  We extracted "Software Programmer" from the text, as it's a general umbrella term for the various roles mentioned.
* **responsibilities:** I created generic responsibilities common to software programming roles, ensuring each sentence is around 15 words.
* **required_skills:** I listed the skills mentioned as "REQUIRED SKILLS" in the text, repeating each skill for clarity.
* **nice_to_have_skills:** I listed the skills mentioned as "Preferred skills" in the text. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Specificity:**  This is a very general representation. For specific roles like "Java Full Stack Developer" or "Data Scientist," you'd need to tailor the JSON further with more role-specific responsibilities and skills.
* **Skill Ambiguity:** Some skills like "Experience in programming language Java" could be broken down further (e.g., "Java 8", "Spring Framework").
* **Company Context:**  This JSON lacks details about the company's culture, work environment, or specific project types. You'd likely need additional information to fully capture the role's context.
